There are three main scripts:

- run_main.py: This provides code to replicate the main experiments in the paper (described in section 4).
- run_causal_evaluation.py: This runs the evaluation using Karimi et al. (2020) on the german dataset.
- run_nlp.py: This runs the experiment for the NLP case study (appendix).
